EMPRESS Dependencies
=====================================================

1). Data Warehouse / Faodel. EMPRESS relies on Sandia's Data Warehouse / Faodel library for message passing between clients and servers. 
    This library will be publically released shortly on git. 
	a). see data-warehouse/INSTALL.md and data-warehouse/INSTALL_TPL.md for information about building Data Warehouse and for its list of dependencies 
		i). note that in addition to the dependencies listed there, zlib is also required for Data Warehouse/Faodel

	b). Note that several external libraries required by Data Warehouse / Faodel are also required by EMPRESS (cmake 3.2+, boost 1.60+, openmpi, gcc 4.9+)

2). sqlite3. The build is configured to use the sqlite3 amalgamation with sqlite3.h in include/database and sqlite3.c in lib_source/database. 
    This code can be downloaded from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html



EMPRESS Build instructions (starting from EMPRESS install folder):

=====================================================

default build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 

=====================================================

note: cmake may require some parameters:
1). if Data Warehouse / Faodel is not installed as "data-warehouse-release" in the home directory, this -DDATA_WAREHOUSE_SOURCE_DIR will need to be set to the directory's location

2). if boost or google test are not installed in data-warehouse-release/tpl, -DDATA_WAREHOUSE_TPL_INSTALL_DIR will need to be set to this install location

note: these same instructions can be used to build the analysis code (after first going to the testing_source/analysis_code folder).
